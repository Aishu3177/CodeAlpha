A Fibonacci generator in Python is a function or an iterator that produces numbers from the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.


Fibonacci Sequence Generator

A simple Python script that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

About the Project

This project is a basic implementation of the Fibonacci sequence generator. The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. This script allows users to input the number of terms they want and generates the sequence accordingly.

Features

Accepts user input for the number of Fibonacci terms to generate.
Handles edge cases for invalid inputs (like non-integers or negative numbers).
Provides simple and clean output of the Fibonacci sequence.
Technologies Used

Python 3.x
Installation

To use or contribute to this project, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/username/fibonacci-sequence.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

Copy code

cd fibonacci-sequence

Run the script: Ensure you have Python installed, then run the script from the command line:

bash

Copy code

python fibonacci.py

Usage

Once you run the script, it will ask for the number of terms to generate in the Fibonacci sequence.

Example:

bash

Copy code

Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence: 5

Fibonacci sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

If you enter a non-integer or a number less than 1, it will prompt you with an error message.

Code Snippet

python

Copy code

def fibonacci(n):

    fib_sequence = [0, 1]

    for i in range(2, n):

        next_value = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]

        fib_sequence.append(next_value)

    return fib_sequence
